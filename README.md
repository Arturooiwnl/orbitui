# OrbitUI

> **This is a work in progress! 🚧**
>
> OrbitUI is under active development, and there’s still much to do. Whether you’re fixing a typo, creating a new component, or designing a meta-framework integration—we’d love your help!

**Accessible, Customizable, & Lightweight component library**

_A modular, customizable component library to accelerate your Astro projects with pre-built components powered by Tailwind CSS._

## 🤔 Why OrbitUI?

When I was creating static, low-interactivity websites using Astro, I looked for components I could reuse and customize to develop faster without compromising performance or adding unnecessary dependencies. My first choice was shadcn/ui (my favorite library), but it required React as an additional dependency. However, React seemed unnecessary for simple user interfaces. Other alternatives depended on JavaScript frameworks, lacked flexibility, or included extra packages I didn’t need. Building components from scratch worked, but it required more development time: I wanted to focus on content, not reinventing buttons and cards. That’s when I thought:

> What if I create a library inspired by shadcn/ui, but designed specifically for Astro, without overloading the framework with unnecessary dependencies? It’ll be fun...

And that’s how we got here.

## 📖 Documentation

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

### Interactive Components

Components requiring JavaScript (e.g., modals, tabs, dropdowns) Coming Soon...

### Framework Bridges

Although OrbitUI is native to Astro and still in the development phase, I am exploring the integration of optional components compatible with popular frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte.

## 🙌 Special Thanks

OrbitUI would not exist without the prior work of projects like shadcn/ui. Their philosophy of:

- Reusable, "copy-paste-friendly" components
- Customization through Tailwind without hidden magic
- Minimalist yet functional design

has been the guiding principle of this project. Thank you, shadcn/ui and the community, for lighting the way! 🚀
