# Security Policy

Thank you for helping us keep **OrbitUI** and its users secure!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **DO NOT disclose the issue publicly**. Instead, report it privately by visiting the **[Security Tab](https://github.com/nsmichelj/orbitui/security)** of this repository and clicking the **Report a vulnerability** button.

Please include as much detail as possible:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce it
- Potential impact
- Suggested solutions (if applicable)

We will investigate all reports and work to resolve issues promptly.

## Supported Versions

Our goal is to support the **latest major version** of OrbitUI. Security fixes will not be backported to previous versions.
