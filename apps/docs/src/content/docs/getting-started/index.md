OrbitUI is an **accessible, customizable, & lightweight component library** designed to accelerate the development of your [Astro](https://astro.build/) projects using the power of [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

Our goal is to provide you with modular and reusable components that allow you to build attractive and high-performance user interfaces without the overhead of unnecessary dependencies.

## Why OrbitUI?

In the Astro ecosystem, we often look for ways to optimize performance and keep our projects lightweight. While excellent component libraries exist, many depend on JavaScript frameworks that might not be necessary for static sites or those with low interactivity.

OrbitUI was born from the need for an alternative inspired by the philosophy of libraries like `shadcn/ui` —focused on "copy-paste-friendly" components, easy customization via Tailwind, and a minimalist yet functional design— but **designed specifically for Astro**, avoiding adding layers of complexity or unnecessary dependencies when they are not needed.

We want you to focus on the content and logic of your application, not on reinventing basic components from scratch.

## Key Features

Built with performance, accessibility, and developer experience in mind, OrbitUI helps you build better Astro websites, faster.

- Full TypeScript Support
- Easily Customizable
