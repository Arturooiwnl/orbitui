The Checkbox component is a form control that allows users to select one or more options from a list of choices.

## Installation

Add the Checkbox component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add checkbox
```

## Usage
Import the Checkbox component and use it in your forms or interactive elements. You will typically pair a checkbox with a `<label>` element for accessibility. Use the standard HTML `checked` attribute to control its state.
