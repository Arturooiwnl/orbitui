title: Progress
description: Displays the progress of a task or process.
---

The Progress component is used to visualize the completion status of a task, download, or any process that advances over time. It typically consists of a container or track and a bar that fills up to indicate the current progress.

## Installation

Add the Progress component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add progress
```

## Usage

Import the `ProgressContainer` and `Progress` components. Wrap the `Progress` component inside `ProgressContainer`. Use the value prop on the `Progress` component to set the current `progress`.

```astro
---
// index.astro
import { ProgressContainer, Progress } from "@/components/ui/progress"; // This is the default path
---

<ProgressContainer>
  <Progress value={50} />
</ProgressContainer>
```

The value prop should typically be a number between 0 and 100, representing the percentage of completion.

## Props

### ProgressContainer

The `ProgressContainer` component acts as the track or wrapper for the progress bar. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<div>` element would.

### Progress

The `Progress` component represents the filling bar that indicates the current progress level. Accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<div>` element would, and a `value` number the current progress value. Strictly a number between 0 and 100.
