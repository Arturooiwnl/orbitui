title: Card
description: A flexible container for grouping related content.
---

The Card component is a versatile container used to group related content in a visually distinct block. It's commonly used to display information, forms, or actions in a structured format. A Card is composed of several sub-components that define its different areas: `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter`.

## Installation

Add the Card component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add card
```

## Usage

Import the `Card` component and its sub-components (`CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`) and assemble them to create your card structure.

```astro
---
// index.astro
import {
  Card,
  CardHeader,
  CardTitle,
  CardDescription,
  CardContent,
  CardFooter,
} from "@/components/ui/card";
---

<Card>
  <CardHeader>
    <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
    <CardDescription>Optional description for the card header.</CardDescription>
  </CardHeader>

  <CardContent>
    <p>This is the main body of the card.</p>
  </CardContent>

  <CardFooter>
    <p>Card footer content or actions.</p>
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```
