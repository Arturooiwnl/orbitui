The Card component is a versatile container used to group related content in a visually distinct block. It's commonly used to display information, forms, or actions in a structured format. A Card is composed of several sub-components that define its different areas: `CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, and `CardFooter`.

## Installation

Add the Card component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add card
```

## Usage

Import the `Card` component and its sub-components (`CardHeader`, `CardTitle`, `CardDescription`, `CardContent`, `CardFooter`) and assemble them to create your card structure.

  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <PreviewCard>
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>Card Title</CardTitle>
