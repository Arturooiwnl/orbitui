title: Skeleton
description: Display a placeholder preview of your content before it fully loads.
---

The `Skeleton` component provides a low-fidelity representation of elements that are not yet ready. It's commonly used to indicate loading states, giving users a sense of progress and reducing perceived wait times by showing the layout of the content that will eventually appear.

The `Skeleton` component acts as a container that applies an animating pulse effect, while `SkeletonItem` is used for the individual placeholder blocks within it.

## Installation

Add the `Skeleton` and `SkeletonItem` components to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add skeleton
```

## Usage

Import the `Skeleton` and `SkeletonItem` components and use them in your Astro components or pages. Wrap your `SkeletonItem` instances within the `Skeleton` component to apply the pulsing animation.

You'll typically apply `w-` and `h-` utility classes to `SkeletonItem` to define the dimensions of your placeholder blocks, mimicking the size of the content they represent.

```astro

// index.astro
import { Card, CardContent } from "@/components/ui/card"; // Assuming Card is also available
import { Skeleton, SkeletonItem } from "@/components/ui/skeleton";

<Skeleton class="flex max-w-xs mx-auto flex-col space-y-3">
  <SkeletonItem class="h-[125px] w-full">

      <rect width="18" height="18" x="3" y="3" rx="2" ry="2"></rect>
      <circle cx="9" cy="9" r="2"></circle>
      <path d="m21 15-3.086-3.086a2 2 0 0 0-2.828 0L6 21"></path>
    </svg>
  </SkeletonItem>
  <div class="space-y-2">
    <SkeletonItem class="h-4 w-[90%]" />
    <SkeletonItem class="h-4 w-[70%]" />
  </div>
</Skeleton>
```

## Props

### Skeleton

The `Skeleton` component acts as a wrapper for the pulsing animation. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `div` element would.

### SkeletonItem

The `SkeletonItem` component represents an individual content block that is being loaded. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `div` element would.
