title: Kbd 
description: A component to display keyboard inputs, such as key presses or key combinations, in a visually distinct way.
---

import PreviewCard from "@/components/PreviewCard.astro";
import { Kbd } from "@/components/ui/kbd";
import { TabItem, Tabs } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

The Kbd component is used to represent user input from a keyboard, voice input, or any other text-entry device. It's ideal for documentation, tutorials, or user interfaces where you need to clearly indicate which keys a user should press.


<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <PreviewCard>
      <Kbd>enter</Kbd>
    </PreviewCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```astro
    ---
    // index.astro
    import { Kbd } from "@/components/ui/kbd";
    ---

    <Kbd>enter</Kbd>
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Installation
Add the Kbd component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add kbd
```

## Usage

Import the `Kbd` component and place the key or key combination you want to display as its child.

### Props

### Kbd

The `Kbd` component renders a small box around its content, making it look like a physical key on a keyboard. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<kbd>` element would.
