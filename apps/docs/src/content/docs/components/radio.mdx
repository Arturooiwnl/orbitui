title: Radio
description: Allows users to select a single option from a set of choices.
---


The `Radio` component is a form control that allows users to select exactly one option from a mutually exclusive set of choices. Radio buttons with the same `name` attribute are treated as a single group.

## Installation

Add the Radio component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add radio
```

## Usage
Import the `Radio` component and use it in your forms or interactive elements. `Radio` buttons are typically used in groups, where each button in the group shares the same name attribute but has a unique value. Use the standard HTML `checked` attribute to pre-select an option. It is essential to pair a radio button with a `<label>` element for accessibility.

```astro
---
// index.astro
import { Radio } from "@/components/ui/radio";
---

<div>
  <Radio id="option-one" name="my-options" value="one" />
</div>
```
## Props

### Radio
the `Radio` component accepts all standard HTML attributes for an `<input>` element, except for the `type` attribute (as it's fixed to 'radio').
