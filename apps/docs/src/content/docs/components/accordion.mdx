The `Accordion` component is a flexible UI element that organizes content into vertically stacked, collapsible sections. It's commonly used for FAQs, feature lists, or any scenario where you need to display a lot of information in a compact, organized manner.

The `Accordion` system comprises a main `Accordion` wrapper, individual `AccordionItem` components, an `AccordionTrigger` to toggle content, and the `AccordionContent` which holds the collapsible content.

## Installation

Add the `Accordion` component and its sub-components to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add accordion
```

## Usage

Import the `Accordion` component along with `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger`, and `AccordionContent`. Wrap your `AccordionItem` components within the main `Accordion` container. Each `AccordionItem` should contain an `AccordionTrigger` (the clickable header) and an `AccordionContent` (the collapsible body).

## Props

The `Accordion` system consists of several components, each with its own set of props:

### Accordion

The main `Accordion` component serves as the container for all `AccordionItem`s and controls the behavior of the group (e.g., single or multiple open items). 

This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<div>` element would. Plus the following:

| Prop       | Type      | Default |
| ---------- | --------- | ------- |
| `multiple` | `boolean` | `false` |

- `multiple`: multiple accordion items can be open simultaneously. If false, opening one item will close others.

### AccordionItem

The `AccordionItem` component acts as a wrapper for a single collapsible section, containing both its AccordionTrigger and AccordionContent.

This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<div>` element would.

| Prop   | Type      | Default |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| `isOpen` | `boolean` | `false` |

- `isOpen`: Controls the visibility state of the content (true for open, false for closed). This prop is managed internally by the Accordion logic but can be used for initial state if exposed.


### AccordionTrigger

The `AccordionTrigger` component acts as the interactive header that toggles the visibility of its associated `AccordionContent`. It's semantically rendered as a `<button>` element, nested within an `<h3>` tag for proper document structure. accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<button>` element would.

### AccordionContent

The `AccordionContent` component contains the actual content that is hidden or revealed when its corresponding `AccordionTrigger` is activated.
