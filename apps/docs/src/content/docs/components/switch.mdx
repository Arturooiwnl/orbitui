import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import PreviewCard from "@/components/PreviewCard.astro";
import { Switch } from "@/components/ui/switch";

The Switch component provides a visual toggle that allows users to turn a setting or option on or off. It's often implemented semantically as a checkbox with custom styling.

## Installation

Add the Switch component to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add switch
```

## Usage

Import the `Switch` component and use it in your forms or settings panels. Since it's based on an input, you can use standard HTML input attributes like `id`, `name`, `value`, and `disabled`. Use the `checked` attribute to control its toggle state (on or off). It is highly recommended to pair a Switch with a `<label>` element for accessibility.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Preview">
    <PreviewCard>
      <div class="flex gap-2 items-center">
        <span>OFF</span>
        <Switch id="toggle-setting" />
        <span>ON</span>
      </div>
    </PreviewCard>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```astro
    ---
    import { Switch } from "@/components/ui/switch";
    ---

    <div class="flex gap-2 items-center">
      <span>OFF</span>
      <Switch id="toggle-setting" />
      <span>ON</span>
    </div>
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Props

### Switch

The `Switch` component accepts all standard HTML attributes for an `<input>` element, except for the `type` attribute (as it's implicitly 'checkbox').
