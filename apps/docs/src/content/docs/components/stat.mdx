The `Stat` component is designed for presenting individual statistics or key performance indicators (KPIs) in a clear and concise manner. It helps highlight important data points, making them easily digestible for users. It is composed of a main Stat wrapper and sub-components for its title, value, and description.

## Installation
Add the Stat component and its sub-components to your project using the OrbitUI CLI:

```bash
npx orbitkit@latest add stat
```

## Usage

Import the `Stat`, `StatTitle`, `StatValue`, and `StatDescription` components. Wrap your statistic content within the main Stat component, using `StatTitle` for the metric's name, `StatValue` for its numerical or primary value, and `StatDescription` for any additional context.

## Props

The Stat system consists of the following components, each with its own set of props:

### Stat

The `Stat` component serves as the main container for a single statistic, ensuring proper layout and grouping of its sub-elements. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<div>` element would.

### StatTitle

The `StatTitle` component is used to display the name or label of the statistic. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<h3>` element would.

### StatValue

The `StatValue` component displays the primary value of the statistic. This is typically a number, percentage, or other key metric. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<span>` element would.

### StatDescription

The `StatDescription` component provides additional context, a brief explanation, or a time frame for the statistic. This component accepts all the standard HTML attributes that a `<p>` element would.
